Employees can create Components requests and submit to Requistion managers.
They can request for multiple Components/Product.
For each product in the request, i need an option to select whether the product can get by a Purchase Order or Internal Transfer.
If it is a PO can create RFQ for multiple vendors
The Request first need to approve by Requistion department manager then requisition Head.
Only Requisition Head can Reject the Request.
Only Requisition Users can create the requests.
